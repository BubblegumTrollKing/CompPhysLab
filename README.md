# Computational Physics Laboratory
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Computational Physics Laboratory course (PHZ1140C) at Florida State University. This course is designed for incoming physics majors. The premise of the course is that interesting, and instructive, physics investigations can still be undertaken by dedicated students even if they have only just started their formal physics courses. For example, a student who has mastered the numerical algorithm for solving a set of coupled 1st-order ordinary differential equations (ODE) is equipped to investigate several interesting systems.
