# Computational Physics Laboratory
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Computational Physics Laboratory course (PHZ1140C) at Florida State University. This course is designed for incoming physics majors. The premise of the course is that instructive physics investigations can be undertaken by dedicated students even if they have barely begun their formal university physics education. For example, a student who has made the effort to master an algorithm for numerically solving a set of coupled 1st-order ordinary differential equations (ODE) is fully equipped to investigate many interesting physical systems.
