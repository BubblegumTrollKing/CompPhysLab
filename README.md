# Computational Physics Laboratory
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Computational Physics Laboratory course, PHZ1140C, at Florida State University. This course is designed for incoming physics majors who have yet to take their introductory physics classes. The premise of the course is that a dedicated student can still engage in a wide range of interesting physics investigations using relatively simple numerical methods. For example, once a student knows how to solve numerically a set of coupled 1st-order ordinary differential equations (ODE) there are many systems that can be investigated.
