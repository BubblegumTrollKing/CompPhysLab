# Computational Physics Laboratory
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Computational Physics Laboratory course, PHZ1140C, at Florida State University. This course is designed for incoming physics majors. Therefore, the instructor must introduce whatever mathematics and physics concepts are needed for the topic at hand. The premise of the course is that interesting, and instructive, physics investigations can still be undertaken by a dedicated student even if the student has yet to take the formal physics courses. For example, once a student has mastered how to solve numerically a set of coupled 1st-order ordinary differential equations (ODE) there are many systems that can be investigated.
