    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to help you understand the concept of a __Taylor series__ expansion of a function. Both the derivative (see 01_derivatives.ipynb) and Taylor series are needed to derive a formula to approximate solutions of Newton's second law of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivative: recap\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at $x$ is the following ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is an __infinitely small number__. It is important to note that this is an exact formula. But when $h$ is a finite number, the formula is no longer exact. Note also, that we can rewrite the exact formula as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f(x + h) & = f(x) + f^{(1)}(x) \\, h ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f^{(1)}(x) \\equiv df/dx$. This is a very interesting formula because it shows how, given the function $f(x)$ and its derivative $f^{(1)}(x)$ at $x$, we can compute the function at $x + h$. This is exactly the kind of algorithm we want to solve Newton's second law in a step by step way. In practice, of course, we must use a small value for $h$. This method of solving an ordinary differential equation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{dx} = g(x, f),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is a known function of $x$ and $f$, is called __Euler's method__. It is the simplest numerical method for solving such equations, but, unfortunately, it is not a particularly accurate method because $h$ is, after all, not infinitely small.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taylor series\n",
    "\n",
    "When $h$ is not infinitely small, the formula\n",
    "\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\n",
    "where the symbol ${\\cal O}(h^4)$ means \"of order $h^4$\". This represents all terms of power 4 in $h$ or higher. This formula (which, in general, has an infinite number of terms) is one way to write the __Taylor series__ of $f(x+h)$ around the point $x$. For our purposes, we do not need the terms beyond ${\\cal O}(h^3)$. During my office hours, I'm happy to show you that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    a_2 & = \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!},\\\\\n",
    "    a_3 & = \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "But I invite you to prove this yourself. (*Hint*: consider $x$ fixed, and treat $h$ as a variable. Take the derivative of both sides, twice, with respect to $h$ and also three times. Then, in both expressions, set $h = 0$. What is the derivative of a constant?)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taylor series for vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Taylor series applies to any continuous function, it also applies to vectors. In particular, given the position and velocity vectors $\\vec{r}(t)$ and $\\vec{v}(t)$, respectively, we can compute them at time $t + h$ using the formulas\n",

    "\n",
    "The right hand side contains quantities known at time $t$, while the left hand side at the predictions of what the vectors will be at time $t + h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Newton's second law\n",
    "Recall that Newton's second law of motion for a particle, $\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}$, where, by definition, the acceleration is\n",

Therefore, if the ${\\cal O}(h^3)$ terms in $\\vec{r}(t + h)$ and the ${\\cal O}(h^2)$ term in $\\vec{v}(t + h)$ are considered to be small enough by virtue of choosing a small time increment $h$, we have approximate formulae for solving Newton's second law of motion for a particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More accurate formulae\n",
