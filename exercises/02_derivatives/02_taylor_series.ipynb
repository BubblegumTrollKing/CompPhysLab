    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to help you understand the concept of a __Taylor series__ expansion of a function. Both the derivative (see 01_derivatives.ipynb) and Taylor series are needed to derive a formula to approximate solutions of Newton's second law of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivative: recap\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at $x$ is the following ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is an __infinitely small number__. It is important to note that this is an exact formula. But when $h$ is a finite number, the formula is no longer exact. Note also, that we can rewrite the exact formula as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f(x + h) & = f(x) + f^{(1)}(x) \\, h ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f^{(1)}(x) = df/dx$. This is a very interesting formula because it shows how, given the function $f(x)$ and its derivative $f^{(1)}(x)$ at $x$, we can compute the function at $x + h$. This is exactly the kind of algorithm we want to solve Newton's second law in a step by step way. In practice, of course, we must use a small value for $h$. This method of solving and an ordinary differential equation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^{(1)} = g(x, f),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is a known function of $x$ and $f$, is called __Euler's method__. It is the simplest numerical method for solving such equations, but unfortunately, it is not a particularly accurate method because $h$ is, after all, not infinitely small.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taylor series\n",
    "\n",
    "When $h$ is not infinitely small, the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f(x + h) & = f(x) + f^{(1)}(x) \\, h ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "is no longer exact. Moreover, the larger the value of $h$, the worse the approximation. Inspired by this formula, let's consider the following\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f(x + h) & = f(x) + f^{(1)} \\, h  + a_2 \\, h^2 + a_3 \\, h^3 + {\\cal O}(h^4),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the symbol ${\\cal O}(h^4)$ means \"of order $h^4$\". This represents all terms of power 4 in $h$ or higher. This formula (which can have an infinite number of terms) is one way to write the __Taylor series__ of $f(x+h)$ around the point $x$. For our purposes, we do not need the terms beyond ${\\cal O}(h^3)$. During my office hours, I'm happy to show you that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    a_2 & = \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!},\\\\\n",
    "    a_3 & = \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "But I invite you to prove this yourself. (*Hint*: take the derivative of both sides, twice, with respect to $h$ and then set $h = 0$, that is, evaluate the derivatives at $x$. Repeat by taking the derivative a third time and setting $h = 0$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taylor series for vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Taylor series applies to any continuous function, it also applies to vectors. In particular, given the position and velocity vectors $\\vec{r}(t)$ and $\\vec{v}(t)$, respectively, we can compute them at time $t + h$ using the formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\vec{r}(t + h) & = \\vec{r}(t) + \\vec{r}^{(1)}(t) \\, h  + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{r}^{(2)}(t)  \\, h^2 + \\frac{1}{6} \\vec{r}^{(3)}(t)  \\, h^3 + {\\cal O}(h^4),\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Newton's second law\n",
    "Recall that Newton's second law, $\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}$, can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} & = \\vec{v}, \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} & = \\frac{1}{m} \\vec{F} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "When we substitute the second law into the two Taylor series expansions, we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\vec{r}(t + h) & = \\vec{r}(t) + \\vec{v}(t) \\, h  + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\vec{F}(t)}{m}  \\, h^2 + \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{\\vec{F}^{(1)}(t)}{m}   \\, h^3 + {\\cal O}(h^4),\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three terms of the formula for $\\vec{r}(t + h)$ are known, as are the first two terms of $\\vec{v}(t + h)$. Therefore, if we neglect the ${\\cal O}(h^3)$ term in $\\vec{r}(t + h)$ and the ${\\cal O}(h^2)$ term in $\\vec{v}(t + h)$, we have approximate formulae for solving Newton's second law of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also approximate $\\vec{F}^{(1)}(t)$ and obtain more accurate formulae, where $\\vec{r}(t + h)$ now neglects the ${\\cal O}(h^4)$ terms and $\\vec{v}(t + h)$ neglects ${\\cal O}(h^3)$. (*Hint*: Start with $\\vec{F}(t - h) = \\vec{F}(t) - \\vec{F}^{(1)}(t) \\, h + {\\cal O}(h^2)$.) "
